# Basic-Note-Taker
RESTful API for a basic note-taking application using Django

## Requirements

- The API should allow:
  -  create a note, 
  -  read a note 
    -  single by ID
    -  list all
  -  update a note, 
  -  delete notes.
 
- Each note should have a title and content.
- Save Notes to memory is ok
  - maybe use models just because SQLite is easy to implement
- Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the API.
- Include appropriate error handling and validation for note creation and updates.
 
 
- Use a modern backend framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Express) to develop the API.
- Write clear and concise code, follow best practices, and use appropriate design patterns.
- Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the API locally.

- Optionally, you can add additional features or enhancements to showcase your skills and creativity.
