# Basic-Note-Taker
RESTful API for a basic note-taking application using Django

## Requirements

- The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete notes.
- Each note should have a title and content.
- The API should provide endpoints to list all notes, retrieve a single note by ID, create a new note, update an existing note, and delete a note.
  - For the purpose of this task, you can save the notes in memory so don't worry about using a persistance layer like MySQL.
- Use a modern backend framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Express) to develop the API.
- Include appropriate error handling and validation for note creation and updates.
- Write clear and concise code, follow best practices, and use appropriate design patterns.
- Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the API.
- Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the API locally.
- Optionally, you can add additional features or enhancements to showcase your skills and creativity.
